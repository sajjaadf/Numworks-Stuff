# Kaleculator OS

### The best kale themed OS for your calculator you never thought you needed.

This is a fork of [numworks/epsilon](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon) with some useful additions that I personally find convenient. Also, everything is kale-themed. I thought it was funny.

This isn't really meant to be easy to follow or anything. I just wanted to show everyone my changes, in case they wanted to check them out. Please don't contact me about issues that aren't related to the code I added, that would be better on the main repo.

Some features include:

- [Useful chemistry constants in the toolbox](https://twitter.com/tjhorner/status/906790966924734464)
  - Avogadro's number
  - Every element's molar mass
- Charging LED
  - This was actually already in the OS, I just changed the makefile
- Green kale theme
- Kale logo
- Calculation -> Kaleculation

## Submitting issues

Issues are for **FEATURE IDEAS ONLY**. Please do not submit any _bug reports_. I will not actively be hunting for bugs. If you want to do some bug hunting, please do check out [the base epsilon repo](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon) that this was forked from. I'm sure they'd appreciate your reports :)
